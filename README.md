# hello-world

I'm Jamie. I'm from rural South Australia. I'm studying a Bachelor of Software Engineering (Hons) at Deakin Uni.

In my last job working as a lab technician I found myself looking after the lab analysis spreadsheet. After doing an online course on VBA for excel, I was able to get the csv files produced by the lab equipment to automatically upload to the spreadsheet and make a number of other improvements. I realised I was enjoying that a lot more than the day to day lab analysis so applied for this course.

In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my wife and two dogs, playing and coaching cricket, getting in the gym and gaming (both Switch and boardgames).

I look forward to pushing myself how to program in more languages.
